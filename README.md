# Electron Force Field Project

This repository contains Python-based programs developed as part of the Electron Force Field (EFF) project.

- **Data/**  
  Contains files and scripts for acquiring and processing data from the Computational Chemistry Comparison and Benchmark DataBase (CCCBDB) hosted by NIST: [https://cccbdb.nist.gov/](https://cccbdb.nist.gov/).

- **ML-EFF/**  
  Contains files used to train and evaluate a machine-learned electron force field. This model is initialized using parameters derived from our existing spline-based electron force field, which is implemented in MATLAB.
