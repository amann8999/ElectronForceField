This is a repository for Python-based programs in the Electron Force Field project.

The Data folder contains files used to obtain data from the Computational Chemistry Comparison and Benchmark DataBase (https://cccbdb.nist.gov/).

The NeuralNetwork folder contains a file used to pretrain a neural network to replicate the best pairwise electron force field produced by our current MATLAB code.
